  "description" : "This is a e-commerce hybrid website using Drupal as a backoffice and NodeJS + AngularJS as front. I worked full-stack on this project, mostly on the front (CSS & Angular). I made a pretty complex cart system, and all about orders. It was a really rewarding experience as web developer.",
